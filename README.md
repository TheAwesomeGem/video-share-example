This is a video sharing app that I made in a day to showcase how to use MVP and SQLite together with Async task to look up videos without interruptions.


TODO:

* Add video player and streaming.
* Add user account where they can upload/link video.
* Use MySQL with Restful API instead of using SQLite to fetch video data.
